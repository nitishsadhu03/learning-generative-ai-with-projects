# Learning Generative AI with Projects

This repository contains various projects focused on learning and implementing Generative AI techniques mainly using Langchain.

## Projects List

1. **Chatbot**: The chatbot leverages the power of LangChain to handle conversational flows, the Gemini API for advanced NLP capabilities, and Streamlit to create an interactive web interface for users.

2. **Restaurant Name and Menu Generator**: Users can select a cuisine from a dropdown menu, and the model will generate a fancy name for a restaurant with that cuisine, along with some menu items related to that cuisine.

3. **News Research Tool**: Users can input up to three URLs of news articles. The tool processes these articles, generates embeddings using the Gemini API, and stores them in a FAISS index. Users can then input questions, and the tool will retrieve and provide answers based on the content of the articles.
